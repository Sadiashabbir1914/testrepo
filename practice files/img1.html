           <h1>Life quote</h1>
           <p>This is the case of a self-righteous man who is pure in his own eyes. So, he considers everything he does and every way he walks as pure, despite not being cleansed from his filthiness. He forgets that his best righteousness is as a filthy rag.
    
     
    
            Proverbs chapter 16 verse 25 says –
            
            “There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.”
    
            <li>Don't be right in your own eyes!</li>
            <li> Yield yourself in obedience to the word of God!</li>
            <li>Don't consider yourself as somebody who is pure in what you are doing.</li>
            
            
             
            
            It is only the word of God that can purify you. And as you are yielded to the word of God, the word of God teaches you the way to go to profit. It teaches you the way God has approved of you.</p>
    
            <p>So, the wicked man lives his life expecting that he will live 
                long and he does everything to extend his life. He lives his
                life, desiring to get more riches that will help him to obtain
                more honour from men, and not from God.</p>
