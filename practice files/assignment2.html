       <h1>Wisdom quote</h1>
       <p>Many people live their lives, thinking that they will never 
        die!  But if they know that “it is appointed to man once to die,
        after that judgment”; they will live their lives in accordance
        with the will of their Creator – our God the Father, who sent
        forth His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him 
        should not perish, but have everlasting life!</p>

        <p>So, the wicked man lives his life expecting that he will live 
            long and he does everything to extend his life. He lives his
            life, desiring to get more riches that will help him to obtain
            more honour from men, and not from God.
            The wicked man lives his life in pleasure, not pleasing God! 
            They are focused on pleasing themselves and getting the praises
            of men. They think that by doing this, they are enjoying their
            lives; but truth is : they are living unto themselves and not 
            unto the LORD. And he will find out at the end when he dies, 
            that all his expectations in the world are vain! 
            It is all:  vanity upon vanity!!</p>
        <p>That’s why the scripture says: “When a wicked man dieth,
             his expectation shall perish:” </p>
        <p>Don’t live a wicked life, not acknowledging the God who created you,
             and who has given you the opportunity to come into a relationship
              with Him through His Son Jesus Christ. For those who believe and
               receive what Jesus Christ did for mankind on the cross of 
               Calvary, they know He has given them “… the right to become 
               children of God!</p>

       <h1>Life quote</h1>
       <p>This is the case of a self-righteous man who is pure in his own eyes. So, he considers everything he does and every way he walks as pure, despite not being cleansed from his filthiness. He forgets that his best righteousness is as a filthy rag.

 

        Proverbs chapter 16 verse 25 says –
        
        “There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.”

        <li>Don't be right in your own eyes!</li>
        <li> Yield yourself in obedience to the word of God!</li>
        <li>Don't consider yourself as somebody who is pure in what you are doing.</li>
        
        
         
        
        It is only the word of God that can purify you. And as you are yielded to the word of God, the word of God teaches you the way to go to profit. It teaches you the way God has approved of you.</p>

        <p>So, the wicked man lives his life expecting that he will live 
            long and he does everything to extend his life. He lives his
            life, desiring to get more riches that will help him to obtain
            more honour from men, and not from God.</p>

       <h1>manners quote</h1>
       <p>You can deceive people: but you cannot deceive God. Know it, that God weighs your spirit. He weighs what you are doing. Whatever you are doing is put in the balance of the word of God. If it fails in the balance, you have failed! So, don't mark yourself right when the word of God is condemning what you are doing!
        For “All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.”   
        God spoke to Israel in Jeremiah chapter 2 from verse 21. He said –
        
        “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?”   
        
        God chose Israel and planted it as a right seed; a seed that many other nations shall come to lend from; a righteous seed.</p>
