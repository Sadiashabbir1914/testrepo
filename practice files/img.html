           <p>You can deceive people: but you cannot deceive God. Know it, that God weighs your spirit. He weighs what you are doing. Whatever you are doing is put in the balance of the word of God. If it fails in the balance, you have failed! So, don't mark yourself right when the word of God is condemning what you are doing!
            For “All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.”   
            God spoke to Israel in Jeremiah chapter 2 from verse 21. He said –
            
            “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?”   
            
            God chose Israel and planted it as a right seed; a seed that many other nations shall come to lend from; a righteous seed.</p>
