           <h1>Wisdom quote</h1>
           <p>Many people live their lives, thinking that they will never 
            die!  But if they know that “it is appointed to man once to die,
            after that judgment”; they will live their lives in accordance
            with the will of their Creator – our God the Father, who sent
            forth His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him 
            should not perish, but have everlasting life!</p>
    
            <p>So, the wicked man lives his life expecting that he will live 
                long and he does everything to extend his life. He lives his
                life, desiring to get more riches that will help him to obtain
                more honour from men, and not from God.
                The wicked man lives his life in pleasure, not pleasing God! 
                They are focused on pleasing themselves and getting the praises
                of men. They think that by doing this, they are enjoying their
                lives; but truth is : they are living unto themselves and not 
                unto the LORD. And he will find out at the end when he dies, 
                that all his expectations in the world are vain! 
                It is all:  vanity upon vanity!!</p>
            <p>That’s why the scripture says: “When a wicked man dieth,
                 his expectation shall perish:” </p>
            <p>Don’t live a wicked life, not acknowledging the God who created you,
                 and who has given you the opportunity to come into a relationship
                  with Him through His Son Jesus Christ. For those who believe and
                   receive what Jesus Christ did for mankind on the cross of 
                   Calvary, they know He has given them “… the right to become 
                   children of God!</p>
